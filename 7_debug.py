#example
a = 1
b = 2
c = 3
d = 4
print(a)
#3. The value is 1 here, hence its between point 2 and 3.
e = 5
f = 6
g = 7
print(a)
#4. The value is still 1
a = 8
#5. This is the cause of error!
h = 9
print(a)
#2. The value is still 8 here
i = 8
j = 7
k = 6
l = 5
m = 4
n = 3
o = 2
p = 1
print(a)
#1. The value came out as '8',instead of 1. Trying to debug the error.
